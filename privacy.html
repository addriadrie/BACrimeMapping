    <br><br>
    We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

    We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:

        <li><span class="heading_3">When we use Google Maps Platform APIs.</span> We may share your information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Google Maps API, Places API).</span> Google Maps uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers to estimate your location. GPS is accurate to about 20 meters, while Wi-Fi and cell towers help improve accuracy when GPS signals are weak, like indoors. This data helps Google Maps provide directions, but it is not always perfectly precise.</li>
    </ul>


    <!-- 4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES? -->
    <p class="heading_1" id="cookies">4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</p>
    <strong><em>In Short: </em></strong><em>We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em>
    <br><br>
    We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.
    <br><br>
    We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.
    <br><br>
    Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.


    <!-- 5. DO WE OFFER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED PRODUCTS? -->
    <p class="heading_1" id="ai">5. DO WE OFFER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED PRODUCTS?</p>
    <strong><em>In Short: </em></strong><em>We offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies.</em>
    <br><br>
    As part of our Services, we offer products, features, or tools powered by artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies (collectively, "AI Products"). These tools are designed to enhance your experience and provide you with innovative solutions. The terms in this Privacy Notice govern your use of the AI Products within our Services.
    <br><br>
    <p class="heading_2">Our AI Products</p>
    Our AI Products are designed for the following functions:

   <!-- 6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION? -->
   <p class="heading_1" id="inforetain">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>
   <strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</em>
   <br><br>
   We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than <span>2 years</span>.
   <br>
   When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
   
   
   <!-- 7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE? -->
   <p class="heading_1" id="infosafe">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>
   <strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em>
   <br><br>
   We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
   
   
   <!-- 8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS? -->
   <p class="heading_1" id="infominors">8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</p>
   <strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</em>
   <br><br>
   We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at bantayalisto@gmail.com
    

    <!-- 9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS? -->
   <p class="heading_1" id="privacyrights">9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>
   <strong><em>In Short: </em></strong><em>You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</em>
   <br>
   <span class="heading_3" id="withdrawconsent">Withdrawing your consent:</span> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>" below.
   <br><br>
   However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
   <br><br>
   If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at bantayalisto@gmail.com.
   
   
   <!-- 10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES -->
   <p class="heading_1" id="DNT">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>
   Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
